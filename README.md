Password validation checking is the process of analyzing a user's password to ensure it meets a defined set of criteria that make it secure and resistant to common attacks. This step is essential for maintaining security in online systems and applications. Password validation checking typically involves real-time or server-side analysis to verify if a password complies with established security standards.

Purpose of Password Validation Checking
Enhance Security: Ensures passwords are strong enough to resist attacks such as brute force or dictionary attacks.
Prevent Data Breaches: Helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts.
Improve User Trust: Demonstrates that the platform prioritizes account safety.
Enforce Compliance: Meets industry standards and regulations, such as GDPR or PCI-DSS, which require strong password policies.
Password Validation Criteria
Password validation checking typically involves verifying the following:

Minimum Length: The password must be a certain length, often 8â€“12 characters, to increase complexity.
Uppercase Characters: At least one uppercase letter (e.g., A-Z) to add variation.
Lowercase Characters: At least one lowercase letter (e.g., a-z) to ensure diversity in character case.
Numeric Characters: At least one number (e.g., 0-9) to incorporate additional randomness.
Special Characters: Inclusion of symbols (e.g., !, @, #, $) to make the password less predictable.
No Sequential Patterns: Prevents passwords like "123456" or "abcdef" which are easy to guess.
Avoid Common Passwords: Rejects frequently used passwords like "password" or "qwerty."
